a set of statements that perform a task.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

function keyword followed by function name, then optional parameters, then the code block with optional return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

function name and pass in any arguments if needed.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

function call is when we use the function to get something from it.

function definition is where we define and create the function itself.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

parameters are the placeholder names listed in the function definition.
arguments are the values we pass to the function

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

parameters allow the function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input value ahead of time.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

It causes a value to be outputted from the function. IT also prevents any code after it from being run.
